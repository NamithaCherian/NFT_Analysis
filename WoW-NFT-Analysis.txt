   * Creator of some of the projects 
   * May have bought from a different wallet and transferred

Remarks on this wallet: 
   * The wallet has bought NFTs more times than has sold and managed to make a profit.
   * The buying and selling pattern indicates the same trend as the overall trend with peaks in Jan 2022
   * However, it seems this person has bought NFTs in September 2021 thus being able to leverage the peaks than came in October and January.

* Of the wallets, that minted a high number of NFTs, most of them have not sold the NFT from this account but have transferred it to another account before selling. (as these token IDs are available in the sales data from other wallets)
 
WoW Twitter Data Analysis:


* There is a clear linear progression in the number of followers, following, tweets and favorites from the time the project was released. 


* There is a significant bump in 'favorites' and 'following' for WoW around September 2021.


* This may have contributed to the increase in WoW NFT sales that started around the same time.

* However, some significant peaks can be observed around mid-October and mid-January.
